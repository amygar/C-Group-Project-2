You walk past them and head for class. You hear him screaming "I will kill you all!" from far away. 
At this point you can sense the pain that rests in those words but sympathy won't work for you made your decision.
*
You successfully stop the bullying somehow by resorting to means of persuasion. 
The boy slowly gets up and gives you a small thanks. 
You tell him to not worry for you were doing the right thing. 
He stares at you for a second and says that not a word… 
After the silence becomes too awkward you tell him that you hope to see him again. 
With this you go to class.
*
You finally reach the cafeteria. 
It is full of students as always and as a result the noise levels are off the charts. 
Whatever negative premonition you had earlier it disappeared as soon as you began to enjoy your food. However, after a couple of minutes, your attention is brought back to your surroundings. 
You hear screams and sounds resembling fireworks. 
You quickly notice the masses running in panic and confusion. 
Unable to understand the situation you begin to run as well. 
Amidst the chaos you find yourself slipping and falling over a red fluid. 
You raise your head and you see a dead student. 
The red fluid is blood and you are covered in it. 
You immediately freak out and get up. There are almost 12 casualties. 
Upon turning around you see the boy from earlier, the one who was being bullied, holding a gun. 
He was aiming at you… You could not react. You felt as if you were frozen in time by your terror. 
This was your first time facing the likes of death. 
The boy opened fire and you felt the impact in your chest. You fell to the floor bleeding profusely. 
You have never felt pain like this before. 
Within your last breaths you begin to regret not having followed your instinct when it was telling you something bad was going to happen. 
Now because of you and your decisions other 12 students are dead, and you will soon join them. 
After a few more seconds the pain ceases and darkness clouds your vision. You are dead.
*
You make sure that the boy does not notice you following him. Eventually he enters a classroom. 
You approach the classroom and peek through a small glass window the door has. 
You can see the classroom is empty. Why would he be in an empty classroom? You ask mentally. 
As you continue to observe you notice he takes out the metallic object he was holding earlier. 
This time you can recognize the object. It is a gun… You know where this is going. 
That boy was going to take revenge on those who bullied him but there was also a chance he might take it on anyone. 
You have to think! What would be best for a course of action?
*
Without wasting any time you dart through the hallways until you find a security. 
You quickly explain the situation to him. 
The security guard immediately informs the police as well as the rest of school security.
They begin the search in seconds after the alarm is issued in the entire school. 
Now that boy knows they are looking for him. After a couple of minutes they catch him near the cafeteria. He flees until there is nowhere to flee to. 
Before he was apprehended he chose to end his life. School was closed at once. 
The incident was documented and investigated. 
They questioned you for quite the time but amidst the interrogation only one thought resided within your mind… That being the possibility that he could have been saved.
*
You open the door carefully so as to not completely cause him to shoot on sight out of fear. 
He sees you and points his gun directly at you. 
You quickly put your hands up so as to let him know you are no threat.
