You start to hear a faint sound among the darkness. The sound does not go away and starts to grow louder. Unable to ignore it for another minute, you find yourself becoming more aware. The same goes for your senses. You realize that the sound is coming from the alarm clock. It is Friday and you have college classes at AU University. You go on with your daily morning routine where you get ready and you eat breakfast. Once done you begin to decide how you want to go about your day, after all, you are an adult.
