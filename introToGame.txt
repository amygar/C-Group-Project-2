The sound of an alarm wakes you up. Friday has arrived and you have school. 
You go on with your daily morning routine which consists of getting ready and eating breakfast. 
Once done you begin to make your way to school. So far Friday is just another ordinary day.
School is not that far so you arrive early and since there is nothing else to do you head straight for class. 
Along the way you come across a commotion. You see a small group in the distance. 
The group turns out to be four boys. Three boys are kicking the life out of one of them. 
What do you do?
